    - **`product_name`**
    - **`quantity_sold`**
    - **`unit_price`**

4. Delete a sale with a specific **`sale_id`**.
5. Update the quantity sold of a sale with a specific **`sale_id`** to a new value.
6. Calculate and display the average unit price of all sales.
7. Retrieve the sale with the maximum unit price.
